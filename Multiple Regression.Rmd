## R Markdown

This is the markdown file for our final project. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# 1. Abstract. One parapgraph summary what we set out to learn and what final conclusions were. 
```

# 2. Introduction. Discussion of the research and business in question. 

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
